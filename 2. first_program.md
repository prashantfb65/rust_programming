## First program

### Creating a Project Directory

```sh
mkdir projects
cd projects
mkdir hello_world
cd hello_world
```

### Writing and Running a Rust Program

```sh
touch main.rs
```

Filename: main.rs
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
The main function is special: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program. Here, the first line declares a function named main that has no parameters and returns nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses ().

The function body is wrapped in {}. Rust requires curly brackets around all function bodies. Itâ€™s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.

println! calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it would be entered as println (without the !).

```sh
rustc main.rs
./main
```
