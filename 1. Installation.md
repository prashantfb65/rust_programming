## Installation Guide 
The first step is to install Rust. Weâ€™ll download Rust through rustup, a command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools.

### Installing rustup on Linux or macOS

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Install xcode if not installed already as some common Rust packages depend on C code and will need a C compiler.

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

### Updating and Uninstalling

```sh
rustup update
```

```sh
rustup self uninstall
```

### Automatic formatting with rustfmt

```sh
rustup component add rustfmt
```

This command gives you rustfmt and cargo-fmt, similar to how Rust gives you both rustc and cargo. To format any Cargo project, enter the following:

```sh
cargo fmt
```
