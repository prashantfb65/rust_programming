## Processing a Guess

The first part of the guessing game program will ask for user input, process that input, and check that the input is in the expected form. To start, we’ll allow the player to input a guess. Enter the code in Listing 2-1 into src/main.rs.

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");
}
```

This code contains a lot of information, so let’s go over it line by line. To obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the io input/output library into scope. The io library comes from the standard library, known as std.

By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the prelude, and you can see everything in it in the standard library documentation.

If a type you want to use isn’t in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a use statement. Using the std::io library provides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept user input.

### Storing Values with Variables
```rust
let mut guess = String::new();
```
In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a value, the value won’t change. To make a variable mutable, we add mut before the variable name.

let mut guess = String::new(); line has created a mutable variable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a String.

### Receiving User Input

```rust
io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut guess)
```

We call the stdin function from the io module, which will allow us to handle user input. The line .read_line(&mut guess) calls the read_line method on the standard input handle to get input from the user. We’re also passing &mut guess as the argument to read_line to tell it what string to store the user input in. The full job of read_line is to take whatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string (without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an argument. The string argument needs to be mutable so the method can change the string’s content.

The `&` indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature, and one of Rust’s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use references. Like variables, references are immutable by default. Hence, you need to write &mut guess rather than &guess to make it mutable.

### Generating a Secret Number

Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. The secret number should be different every time so the game is fun to play more than once. We’ll use a random number between 1 and 100 so the game isn’t too difficult. Rust doesn’t yet include random number functionality in its standard library. However, the Rust team does provide a rand crate with said functionality.

We specify the rand crate with the semantic version specifier 0.8.5.
Cargo understands Semantic Versioning (sometimes called SemVer), which is a standard for writing version numbers. The specifier 0.8.5 is actually shorthand for ^0.8.5, which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but below 0.9.0.

```rust
use rand::Rng;
```

The Rng trait defines methods that random number generators implement, and this trait must be in scope for us to use those methods.
We call the `rand::thread_rng` function that gives us the particular random number generator we’re going to use: one that is local to the current thread of execution and is seeded by the operating system. Then we call the gen_range method on the random number generator. This method is defined by the Rng trait that we brought into scope with the use `rand::Rng;` statement


### Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number

Now that we have user input and a random number, we can compare them. 

```rust
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
```
First we add another `use` statement, bringing a type called `std::cmp::Ordering` into scope from the standard library. The Ordering type is another enum and has the variants Less, Greater, and Equal. These are the three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.

The `cmp` method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be compared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it’s comparing guess to secret_number. Then it returns a variant of the Ordering enum we brought into scope with the use statement. We use a `match` expression to decide what to do next based on which variant of Ordering was returned from the call to cmp with the values in guess and secret_number.

```rust
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
```
We create a variable named guess. But wait, doesn’t the program already have a variable named guess? It does, but helpfully Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of guess with a new one. Shadowing lets us reuse the guess variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as guess_str and guess, for example.

The parse method on strings converts a string to another type. Here, we use it to convert from a string to a number. We need to tell Rust the exact number type we want by using `let guess: u32`


### Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping

The loop keyword creates an infinite loop. We’ll add a loop to give users more chances at guessing the number.

```rust
// --snip--
println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
loop {
    println!("Please input your guess.");
    // --snip--
    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
}
```

### Handling Invalid Input

To further refine the game’s behavior, rather than crashing the program when the user inputs a non-number, let’s make the game ignore a non-number so the user can continue guessing. We can do that by altering the line where guess is converted from a String to a u32

We switch from an expect call to a `match` expression to move from crashing on an error to handling the error. Remember that parse returns a `Result` type and `Result` is an enum that has the variants `Ok` and `Err`. We’re using a `match` expression here, as we did with the Ordering result of the `cmp` method.

```rust
// --snip--

io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut guess)
    .expect("Failed to read line");

let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) => num,
    Err(_) => continue,
};

println!("You guessed: {guess}");

// --snip--

```
