## Common Programming concepts

### Variables and Mutability
By default, variable are immutable. However, you still have the option to make your variables mutable.
When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can‚Äôt change that value.

### Constants
Like immutable variables, constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants and variables.
First, you aren‚Äôt allowed to use mut with constants. Constants aren‚Äôt just immutable by default‚Äîthey‚Äôre always immutable. You declare constants using the const keyword instead of the let keyword, and the type of the value must be annotated. 

```rust
const HOUR_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60;
```

The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.


### Shadowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

The first variable is shadowed by the second, which means that the second variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable. 


### Data Types

Keep in mind that Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. It has two data type subsets: `scalar` and `compound`.

#### Scalar Types

A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

1. Integer types: An integer is a number without a fractional component. Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. Signed and unsigned refer to whether it‚Äôs possible for the number to be negative‚Äîin other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned).

    Length | Signed | Unsigned
    --- | --- | --- |
    8-bit | i8 | u8
    16-bit | i16 | u16
    32-bit | i32 | u32
    64-bit | i64 | u64
    128-bit | i128 | u128
    arch | isize | usize
    ---

Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers from -(27) to 27 - 1, which equals -128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n - 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

Additionally, the isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as ‚Äúarch‚Äù: 64 bits if you‚Äôre on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you‚Äôre on a 32-bit architecture.


2. Floating-Point Types

Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust‚Äôs floating-point types are f32 and f64, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs, it‚Äôs roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types are signed.

Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

3. Numeric operations: Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you‚Äôd expect for all the number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

4. Boolean Type: Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: true and false. Booleans are one byte in size. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

5. The Character type: Rust‚Äôs char type is the language‚Äôs most primitive alphabetic type.

e.g.
```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = '‚Ñ§'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'üòª';
}
```

Rust‚Äôs char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive. However, a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù is may not match up with what a char is in Rust. 


#### Compound Types

Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

1. Tuple: A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (.)

e.g.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```


2. Arrays

Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```
You write an array‚Äôs type using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:
```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let b = [3; 5];
```

accessing array elements:
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

### Functions

The fn keyword allows you to declare new functions.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

1. Parameters: parameters are special variables that are a part of a function's signature 

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

The declaration of another_function has one parameter named x. The type of x is specified as i32. When we pass 5 in to another_function, the println! macro puts 5 where the pair of curly brackets containing x was in the format string.

2. Statements and Expressions

Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.

Expressions evaluate to a resultant value. Let‚Äôs look at some examples.

Example of expressions below:
```rust
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

The expression is:

```rust
let x = 3;
x + 1
```
Note that the `x + 1` line doesn‚Äôt have a semicolon at the end, which is unlike most of the lines you‚Äôve seen so far. Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.

### Control Flow

The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is `true` and to run some code repeatedly while a condition is true are basic building blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are `if` expressions and `loops`.

1. if Expressions

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

else if

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;
    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

Using if in a let Statement

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

2. Repetition with Loops

Rust has three kinds of loops: loop, while, and for. Let‚Äôs try each one.

a. Loop
```rust
loop {

}
```
If you have loops within loops, break and continue apply to the innermost loop at that point. You can optionally specify a loop label on a loop that you can then use with break or continue to specify that those keywords apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin with a single quote. Here‚Äôs an example with two nested loops:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;
        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }
        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}
```

b. while loop

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;
    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");
        number -= 1;
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

c. for loop

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```

reverse the loop
```rust
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
